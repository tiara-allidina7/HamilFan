[HAMILTON AND MEN]
Always—

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]

Always—

[ANGELICA]

Be satisfied

[HAMILTON AND MEN]

Rewind—

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]

Rewind—

[Recorded Samples]
Rewind, Rewind
Helpless, sky's, sky's
Drownin' in em
Drownin', rewind

I remember that night, I just might (rewind)
I remember that night, I just might (rewind)
I remember that night, I remember that—

[ANGELICA]
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days

I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise

I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place

But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face

I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame

[FULL COMPANY]
This is not a game…

[HAMILTON]
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You forget yourself

[HAMILTON]
You’re like me. I’m never satisfied

[ANGELICA]
Is that right?

[HAMILTON]
I have never been satisfied

[ANGELICA]
My name is Angelica Schuyler

[HAMILTON]
Alexander Hamilton

[ANGELICA]
Where’s your fam’ly from?

[HAMILTON]
Unimportant. There’s a million things I haven’t done but
Just you wait, just you wait…

[ANGELICA]
So so so—
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a
Bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is…

[ELIZA]
Helpless…

[ANGELICA]
And I know she is…

[ELIZA]
Helpless…

[ANGELICA]
And her eyes are just…

[ELIZA]
Helpless…

[ANGELICA]
And I realize

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time…

[HAMILTON]
Where are you taking me?

[ANGELICA]
I’m about to change your life

[HAMILTON]
Then by all means, lead the way

[COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA)]
Number one!

[ANGELICA]
I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less

[ELIZA]
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you

[HAMILTON]
Schuyler?

[ANGELICA]
My sister

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[ANGELICA]
He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

[ELIZA]
Thank you for all your service

[HAMILTON]
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

[ANGELICA]
I’ll leave you to it

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[ANGELICA]
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, “I’m fine”

[ANGELICA AND COMPANY]
She’d be lying

[ANGELICA]
But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn’t sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life…

[ANGELICA]
To the groom!

[ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
